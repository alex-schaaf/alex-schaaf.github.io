I'm a geologist by training, software engineer by profession and running addict by passion.

- I develop software at [alcemy](http://alcemy.tech) to help the cement & concrete industry reduce their massive carbon footprint.
- I've spent nearly 3 years pursuing a PhD in computational geology - until I decided to ditch research and work in software full time.
- I'm currently based in Germany.
- I was an early contributor to [GemPy](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy), an open-source geological research software.
